        I cherish the moment we became the Peeks, and every day, my love for you grows stronger. It's like the lyrics in 'Murder in the City' say, "and the love that let us share our name." I am so happy and proud to be a Peek alongside you.

        In just over a year of marriage, we've shared countless moments of laughter and joy. Our love is like the lyrics, "I swear when I grow up, I won't just buy you a rose, I will buy the flower shop, so you will never be lonely." One day, I hope to make that dream come true because you deserve all the flowers in the world.

        Your smile is my favorite thing, and I promise that when you need one, I'll gladly give you mine. Thank you for being patient during football season, and for taking me on that wonderful adventure in Savannah. I'm immensely proud of your hard work and dedication as you pursue your dream of becoming an Anesthesia Assistant. I believe with all my heart that you will change the lives of countless patients and make a huge impact on the world. I will always be your #1 fan.

        Hannah, you make me feel like a boy with a crush every day. After nearly 4 years of being together, I still get butterflies when I ask you on dates, cuddle with you on the couch, or whenever you hold my hand or lean in for a kiss. You are the most beautiful, sweet, funny, and smart person I know, and I am so fortunate to call you my wife.

        Our journey through life is shared with the furry members of our family, Bentley, Thea, Mr. Kitty, and Tex. They bring us so much joy and love, just as we bring love to them. We'll never forget our forever stinky girl, Cali, who may no longer be with us but will always hold a special place in our hearts. Their presence makes our home even warmer and cozier, and I can't wait to see them as part of our future family, alongside our children.

        Hannah, I love you more than words can tell, and our journey together has been the greatest adventure of my life. I can't wait to create even more beautiful memories as Mr. and Mrs. Peek, with our animals, our future family, and the unending joy of being in love with you.
    </p>

    <p>
        I promise to continue to work on myself and become the man that you deserve, and together, we will create the happiness that we both deserve.
